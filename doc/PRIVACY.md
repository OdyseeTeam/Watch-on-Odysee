Watch on Odysee â€“ Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-08-20

Summary
- The extension does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.
- All settings are stored locally using `chrome.storage.local` and can be changed or cleared by the user at any time.
- A small cache of non-personal identifiers (YouTube video/channel IDs and their resolved Odysee paths) is stored locally in IndexedDB to improve performance. You can clear this cache from the extension popup.
- The extension communicates only with the public Odysee API to resolve YouTube IDs to Odysee paths: `https://api.odysee.com/yt/resolve` (path may vary). Requests contain only the YouTube IDs required to perform the lookup.
- No analytics, tracking, cookies, or advertising SDKs are used.

Data We Process
- Local settings: feature toggles such as redirect options and button visibility.
- Local cache: mappings between YouTube IDs and Odysee paths with expiration timestamps.

Data Sharing
- No personal data is shared. Network requests to Odysee APIs include only the IDs necessary to find matching content.

Permissions
- Storage: used to save your settings locally.
- Content scripts: run only on YouTube/Invidious pages to render buttons and perform redirects. No browsing history is read.

User Controls
- You may clear the cache from the popup (Clear Resolver Cache) and remove the extension to delete all associated data.
